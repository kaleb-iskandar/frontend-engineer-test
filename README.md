## Code Challenge: Real-time Search Filter Component

Your task is to create a Vue2 component that displays a list of names and allows the user to filter the list by typing in a search box. The list should be filtered in real-time as the user types. The component should have the following features:

1. Display a list of names (use an array of strings as the data source).
2. Display an input field that the user can type in to filter the list.
3. When the user types in the input field, filter the list of names to only show names that contain the current search string.
4. The filter should be case-insensitive.
5. The filtered list should be displayed in real-time as the user types.

### Instructions

1. Create a new Vue2 component called `SearchFilter` in the `/src/components` directory.
2. Implement the search filter component according to the requirements above.
3. Use Git flow branching model to manage your branches and commits.
4. Once you have completed the task, create a new release on GitHub with the tag `v1.0.0`.

### Notes

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Make sure your solution works correctly and meets all of the requirements listed above.
